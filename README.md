# Product Integration Analysis â€“ Veloura

This case study simulates a product integration analysis for **Veloura**, a fictional fashion brand. The company introduced a new Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tool to improve cross-functional collaboration and workflow efficiency across its Product division. This analysis investigates how the adoption of this tool has impacted:

- Team productivity
- Task completion rates
- Process delays
- Feature adoption across departments

## Dataset

The dataset includes 500 team members across four functional areas:
- Product Development
- Merchandising
- Sourcing
- Production

Each record contains:
- Weekly usage of the PLM tool
- Task completion
- Reported process delays
- User feedback scores

## Objectives

This analysis aims to answer:
- Are teams that adopted the new tool completing more tasks?
- Does the tool reduce process delays?
- How does usage trend from week 1 to week 4?
- What is the average feedback sentiment from users?

## Sample Insights

Some of the key findings that may emerge:
- Feature adopters complete significantly more tasks on average than non-adopters
- Process delays are reduced by up to 40% in teams that adopted the tool
- Teams using the tool show consistent week-over-week engagement growth
- User feedback scores average 4.3 among adopters, compared to 3.5 for non-adopters

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Synthetic data generation
- Jupyter Notebooks
